MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set,
or sharded cluster host.

   :class: note

   If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vcse>`__.
   Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no 
   installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a 
   copyable URI to easily connect |compass-short| to your deployment.

If you need to install |vcse|, see
:ref:`install` for instructions.
