This page outlines how to use |vcse| to connect to a
MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set,
or sharded cluster host.

.. admonition:: MongoDB Atlas
   :class: note

   If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`__.
   Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no 
   installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a 
   copyable URI to easily connect |vsce| to your deployment.

If you need to install |vsce|, see :ref:`install` for instructions.

Considerations
--------------

- When connecting |vsce| to a replica set, it is not
  recommended to connect directly to an individual replica
  set member. If the member to which you are connected switches from a
  :manual:`primary </core/replica-set-primary/>` member to a
  :manual:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary/>` or vice versa as
  the result of an election, |vsce| may either forcibly close
  the connection or display stale data.

  Instead, to connect to a replica set, use either the replica set
  :guilabel:`SRV record` or :guilabel:`Replica Set Name` when 
  filling in your connection information.

.. - If you are using Kerberos as your authentication mechanism, do not 
..  specify the :guilabel:`Password` in the connection form.

.. _vsce-connect-task:

Connect
-------

|vsce| provides two methods to connect to your deployment. You can: 

- Provide your deployment connection string, or 
- Fill in your deployment information in specific fields.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Paste Connection String
      :tabid: paste-connection-string

      When you provide a connection string, |vsce| supports
      most :manual:`Connection String Options
      </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`
      supported by MongoDB.

   .. tab:: Fill in Individual Fields
      :tabid: individual-fields

      .. include:: /includes/steps/starting-vsce-individual-fields.rst

.. _vsce-disconnect-task:

Disconnect
----------

|vsce| provides two methods to connect to your deployment. You can:

- Disconnect with the Command Palette, or
- Disconnect from the :guilabel:`MongoDB` view in the 
  :guilabel:`Activity Bar`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Disconnect with the Command Palette
      :tabid: disconnect-command-palette

      .. include:: /includes/steps/disconnect-command-palette.rst

   .. tab:: Disconnect from the MongoDB View
      :tabid: individual-fields

      .. include:: /includes/steps/disconnect-mongodb-view.rst

Disconnecting from a MongoDB instance closes the |vsce| connection to 
the active instance. You must :ref:`reconnect <vsce-connect-task>` to 
interact with data in your deployment again.
