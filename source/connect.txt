This page outlines how to use |vcse| to connect to a
MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set,
or sharded cluster host.

.. admonition:: MongoDB Atlas
   :class: note

   If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`__.
   Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no 
   installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a 
   copyable URI to easily connect |vsce| to your deployment.

If you need to install |vsce|, see :ref:`install` for instructions.

Considerations
--------------

- When connecting |vsce| to a replica set, it is not
  recommended to connect directly to an individual replica
  set member. If the member to which you are connected switches from a
  :manual:`primary </core/replica-set-primary/>` member to a
  :manual:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary/>` or vice versa as
  the result of an election, |vsce| may either forcibly close
  the connection or display stale data.

  Instead, to connect to a replica set, use either the replica set
  :guilabel:`SRV record` or :guilabel:`Replica Set Name` when 
  filling in your connection information.

- If you are using Kerberos as your authentication mechanism, do not 
  specify the :guilabel:`Password` in the connection form.

Connect
-------

|vsce| provides two methods to connect to your deployment,
either providing your deployment connection string or filling in your
deployment information in specific fields.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Paste Connection String
      :tabid: paste-connection-string

      When you provide a connection string, |vsce| supports
      most :manual:`Connection String Options
      </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`
      supported by MongoDB.
