  If you have the connection string for your deployment available, you
  can paste the string directly into the |vscode-short| Command Palette. 
  You can use either the :manual:`Standard Connection String Format
  </reference/connection-string/#connections-standard-connection-string-format>`
  or the :manual:`DNS Seedlist Connection Format
  </reference/connection-string/#connections-dns-seedlist>`.

  - To obtain the connection string for an |service| cluster:
  
    a. Navigate to your |service| :guilabel:`Clusters` view.

    #. Click :guilabel:`Connect` for your desired cluster.

    #. Click :guilabel:`Connect with MongoDB Compass`.

    #. Copy the provided connection string.

  - To learn how to format the connection string for a deployment
    which is not hosted on |service|, see
    :manual:`Connection String URI Format
    </reference/connection-string>`.

   a. In |vscode-short|, open the Command Palette:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 33 33 34

         * - Operating System
           - Method
           - Actions

         * - Any
           - |vscode-short| Menu
           - :guilabel:`View` > :guilabel:`Command Palette`

         * - MacOS
           - Keyboard Shortcut
           - Press ``Command`` + ``Shift`` + ``P``

         * - Windows and Linux
           - Keyboard Shortcut
           - Press ``Control`` + ``Shift`` + ``P``
   
   #. From the Command Palette, select 
      :guilabel:`Add MongoDB Connection with Connection String`. 

      .. tip::

         Enter ``mongodb`` in the Command Palette to display all of the 
         |vsce| commands you can use.

   #. Paste your connection string into the Command Palette. 

      .. important::

         Ensure that you update the connection string with credentials
         of a database user for your deployment. The connection might 
         succeed without these credentials, but you won't be able to
         interact with data in your deployment.

   #. Press **Enter**.

   #. From the Command Palette, chose where you want to save the 
      connection.

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50 50
         :stub-columns: 1

         * - Option
           - Description

         * - Save the connection on this workspace
           - The connection is available only when you open the
             workspace in which you created the connection in 
            |vscode-short|.

         * - Save the connection globally on vscode
           - The connection is available whenever you open |vscode-short|.

         * - Don't save this connection
           - The connection is available until you close |vscode-short|.

   .. admonition:: Required Access
      :class: important

      Once you are connected to your MongoDB deployment, you may
      require specific :manual:`user roles <reference/built-in-roles/>`
      to access various |vsce| features. For more information
      on the required roles for |vsce| features, see
      :ref:`required-access`.
